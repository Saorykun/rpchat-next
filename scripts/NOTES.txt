This skeleton is designed to be integrated into the legacy project first (bridge mode).

Recommended approach:
1) Add `src/` to PYTHONPATH or install editable.
2) In legacy `game_tab.py`, replace direct calls with ActionEngine.run(Action).
3) Map engine events to existing UI outputs (history, status html, prompt preview, debug trace).
